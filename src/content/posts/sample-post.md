## Welcome to this example post

This is a paragraph of text, and the area where the main content of the blog goes. This blog uses TinaCMS, so approved authors can add and edit posts directly from the cms if they are approved and logged in. The frontend of this blog was made using Astro and Markdown (which is converted into HTML). This frontend was styled with Tailwind CSS and uses ShadCN's UI library. This blog is deployed to Vercel.

## This is an h2 header for this subsection

Here is where the text goes for this example subsection. You should not use h1 tags when writing a post as the post title is already an h1, and having multiple h1s is not good practice. Also, avoid skipping header levels. Always only go down by one header at a time.

```javascript
print("This is an example of a code block");
```

<div class="flex gap-4">
  <p>You can also put an image next to next using html and tailwind css classes. You can adjust the classes as needed to make things look correct</p>
  <img src="/images/example.png" alt="Description" style="margin-right: 10px; width: 100px; height: auto;"/>
</div>
